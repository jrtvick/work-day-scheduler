# Work-Day-Scheduler


## Description

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate third party API use. For example, Dayjs gives the user the ability to display an active clock for current time on their webpage. The reason for building this webpage is to show my knowledge and ability with Third Party APIs, as well as establish more for my portfolio for future when presenting my work to colleagues and potential employers. Understanding things like how jQuery can add function to elements and how backticks work will streamline the process of producing interactive and well functioning sites in the future.
